# Module Categories

This is the proposed list of general categories for classifying modules.

* `bio` - biological and life sciences
* `chem` - chemistry 
* `data` - I/O and data processing tools
* `dev` - development tools (programming/scripting languages, debugging,
  optimization stuff)
* `geo` - geology, geography, geophysics
* `hpc` - high performance computing
* `lib` - software libraries
* `nlp` - natural language processing
* `num` - numerical or mathematical
* `phys` - physics
* `stat` - statistics
* `util` - utilities (editors, browsers)
* `viz` - visualization

Note that a module can and should be classified with multiple categories if
appropriate.


## Tags

The categories listed above are intended to be very general.  In order to
provide more fine-grained grouping of module types, tagwords can be applied to
modules. These can be quite specific, whatever might be helpful in identifying
groups of related modules.

Below are a few commonly applicable tag words:

* astrophysics
* build tools
* climate
* compilers
* database
* debugging
* fluid dynamics
* general programming
* genetics
* genomics
* geography
* high energy physics
* interactive
* image processing
* machine learning
* medicine
* microbiology
* molecular dynamics
* natural language processing
* neuroscience
* numerical analysis
* optimization
* population
* proteins
* programming languages
* python numerical libraries
* statistics
* visualization
